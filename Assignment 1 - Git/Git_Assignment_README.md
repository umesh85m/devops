# Git Assignments

## Objective
This project demonstrates Git fundamentals, branching strategies, stashing, merging, and Git Flow workflows. Each assignment covers practical version control operations aligned with real-world software development practices.

---

## Tasks Completed

### A. Basic Git Operations
- Created a new folder with files: **Code.txt, Log.txt, Output.txt**.  
- Staged `Code.txt` and `Output.txt`, committed them, and pushed to GitHub.  
- Documented all Git commands used in the process.  

---

### B. Branching, Stashing, and Checkout
- Created a Git working directory with **feature1.txt** and **feature2.txt** in the master branch.  
- Created branches: **develop, feature1, feature2**.  
- In `develop` branch: created `develop.txt`, stashed it, switched to `feature1`.  
- In `feature1` branch: created `new.txt`, staged and committed it.  
- Returned to `develop`, unstashed and committed `develop.txt`.  
- Documented all Git commands used.  

---

### C. Branch Creation and Deletion
- Created branches: **develop, f1, f2**.  
- Added and committed `main.txt` in master, `develop.txt` in develop, `f1.txt` in f1, `f2.txt` in f2.  
- Pushed all branches to GitHub.  
- Deleted branch `f2` locally and remotely.  

---

### D. Advanced Branching and Merging
- Created `master.txt` on master branch, staged and committed.  
- Created branches: **public1, public2, private**.  
- Added and committed `public1.txt` on public1 branch.  
- Merged public1 and public2 into master.  
- On private branch, edited `master.txt` and committed changes.  
- Updated public1, public2, and master with private branch changes.  
- Synced new master code across all branches.  

---

### E. Git Flow Workflow
- Implemented **Git Flow architecture** with branches: master, develop, feature, release, hotfix.  
- Created a feature branch and merged changes to master following Git Flow rules.  
- Simulated a hotfix by adding `urgent.txt` directly to master and merging back into develop.  

---

## Git Concepts Demonstrated
- Staging and committing files  
- Branch creation, checkout, and deletion  
- Stashing changes  
- Merging branches  
- GitHub push and sync  
- Git Flow branching strategy

## Outcome
Successfully demonstrated Git fundamentals and advanced workflows including branching, stashing, merging, and Git Flow methodology. These exercises provide a strong foundation in version control for collaborative software development.
